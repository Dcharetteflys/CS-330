How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  one of the things that i gained as a new skill is learning how to really breakdown a large project into smaller steps. this helped me focus on one task at a time. I i have issues with trying to perform to many tasks at once. 
  
What design process did you follow for your project work?
  The process i followed is adding one item per week to the project and edting the other items that were there preivously to allow for a more appealing looking image and code. 
  
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  I am going to apply these items in the future when I decide to start making my own games. I have never done it in the past due to not knowing where to start and how to go about it. THis showed me the proccess that will lead to a higher rate of success. 

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  I tried to stick to a strict schedule when working on my project. This was to help with timing and meeting my deadlines. I didn't want to get lost in working on one aspect for to long and fail to turn in assignments on the correct time
  
How did iteration factor into your development?
  Iteration was especially helpful while learning to develop with OpenGL. Most primitives are built by repeatedly working with sets of coordinates that form triangles. By refining and manipulating these triangles, I was able to create more complex shapes and structures.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  Throughout development, the main change was in my understanding of how to code with OpenGL and recognizing what could and could not be adjusted while programming. I continued to work slowly and modularly, building the project with small, manageable snippets of code at a time.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  At this point, I do not yet have a clear plan for my future career. However, this course introduced me to an area I was once hesitant about, and it has opened the possibility of pursuing a path related to 3D modeling or even game development.
  
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  This showed me the sort of things that a game developer will possible need to do, well the idea at least. This will give me a strong foot hold for my future and a good starting for my learning.
